text: "The battery team is reponsible for constructing a device that powers the car. Every year, the battery team conducts research to compile a list of interesting and feasible electrochemical reactions. After selecting a reaction, the team designs and builds the battery casing which is used in battery testing experiments. Past projects include: zinc-air batteries, magnesium-air batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and pressurized cylinders."
